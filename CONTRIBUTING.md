## Feature Requests and Bug Reports

Feature requests and bug reports should be posted as [Github Issues](issues/new).
In an issue, please describe what you did, what you expected, and what happened instead.

If you think that you have identified an issue with Gem Wallet that might compromise
its users' security, please do not open a public issue on GitHub. Instead,
we ask you to refer to [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).

## Sending Pull Requests

There are several ways to identify an area where you can contribute:

* You can reach out by sending a message in the developer community communication channel, either with a specific contribution in mind or in general by saying "I want to help!".
* Occasionally, some issues on Github may be labelled with `help wanted` or `good first issue` tags.

### Discuss First
Before sending a feature pull request, it's always better to open a issue first to discuss whether it is desired and the design of the feature. 

### Branch Model
We use the [Fork and Pull](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Fork-and-Pull) model and [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) to work on this repository.

Main branch is `master`. This is the branch that is used to work on the official release.

### Commit Convention
We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages. Please read the guide through if you aren't familiar with it already.
