## 🚀 Getting Started

### iOS Development

> [!NOTE]
> Gem iOS needs [Apple silicon Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/116943) to build by default.

1. Setup [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode)
2. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/gemwalletcom/gem-ios.git --recursive`
3. Run `make bootstrap` to install all necessary tools.

If you're using a legacy Intel Mac, you need to pull latest `core` submodule and run `just generate-stone` to build `x86_64` arch Gemstone, the core library used by Gem iOS.
